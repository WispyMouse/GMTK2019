This game was made in 48 hours as a solo project for Game Maker Toolkit's 2019 Game Jam (https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2019), which had "*Only One*" as its game theme.

Our entry, *All I Need Is Explosion*, uses the theme by allowing one giant explosion per level. Will you find decisive victory, or very silly defeat?

Unity3D as the engine, C# as the code base. A quick, single player game.

From a professional perspective, this game is meant to demonstrate an ability to quickly create something from scratch with minimal guidance. It's also aiming to be entertaining and quirky enough to catch an eye.
